# Basic Calculator (Addition & Subtraction)

This is a very simple JavaScript calculator that can add or subtract two numbers entered by the user.

It is one of my first JavaScript exercises and part of my learning journey as a future Full-Stack Developer.

## 🔧 What this project does

- Asks the user for two numbers (using `prompt`)
- Asks the user which operation they want:
  - `addition`
  - `subtraction`
- Uses a function to:
  - take the two numbers and the operation type as parameters
  - calculate the correct result
  - return the result
- Prints the result to the browser console
- Shows an error message if the operation type is invalid

## 📚 What I practiced in this project

This small project helped me practice:

- Getting user input with `prompt`
- Converting string input to numbers with `parseFloat`
- Writing and calling functions
- Using conditional statements (`if / else if / else`)
- Handling simple error cases (invalid operation type)

## ▶️ How to run this project

1. Open any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
2. Open the **Developer Tools**:
   - Windows: `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Opt + I`
3. Go to the **Console** tab.
4. Copy the contents of `basic-calculator.js` and paste it into the console.
5. Press `Enter`.
6. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the first number
   - Enter the second number
   - Type the operation: `addition` or `subtraction`
7. The result will be printed in the console.

## 💡 Possible future improvements

In the next versions of this calculator, I might:

- Add multiplication and division
- Improve input validation (handle empty input, non-numeric values, etc.)
- Build a simple HTML interface instead of using only `prompt`
- Show the result on the web page instead of the console

## 👩‍💻 About me & context

I am currently studying in the **Workintech Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp**.  
This project was created during **Week 1** as part of my practice with basic JavaScript concepts.

My goal is to become a strong **Full-Stack Developer**, and this repository will collect my learning projects and exercises over time.
