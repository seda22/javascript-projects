Basic Calculator — Version 2 (Input Validation Added)
This version builds on Version 1 by adding basic input validation to improve user experience and safety.

In V1, the calculator performed addition and subtraction but did not validate user input.
V2 introduces validation checks to ensure that the numbers and operation type entered by the user are valid before performing any calculation.

🔧 New Features in Version 2
Validates that both numbers are:
not empty
not null or undefined
numeric values
Validates that the operation type is:
not empty
one of the two allowed options:
"addition"
"subtraction"
Provides clear error messages on invalid input
Gives immediate feedback when the operation type is accepted
📌 What Has Not Changed
The core calculation logic from V1 remains the same
Still uses prompt for user input
Still prints the result to the console
This version focuses specifically on improving input safety, not restructuring the calculator.

▶️ How to Run
Open the file basic-calculator-v2.js in your browser console
Follow the prompts:
Enter first number
Enter second number
Choose operation: "addition" or "subtraction"
The console will display validation messages and the final result
🎯 Purpose of Version 2
This update is part of my ongoing JavaScript learning journey.
The goal of V2 is to understand and practice input validation, a key concept in building reliable user-facing applications.

More advanced versions will introduce:

better error handling
stopping execution on invalid input
a cleaner control flow
a web interface instead of prompt
