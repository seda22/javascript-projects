Basic Calculator — Version 1

A beginner-friendly JavaScript calculator

This is the first version of my basic calculator project.
It performs addition and subtraction based on user input.

🔍 Project Description

This calculator:

Asks the user for two numbers

Asks the user to select an operation
(addition or subtraction)

Uses a function to calculate the result

Prints the output to the console

Shows an error message if the operation is invalid

This version focuses on beginner-level JavaScript fundamentals.

🧠 What I Learned in This Project

Taking user input with prompt()

Converting strings to numbers using parseFloat()

Writing a function that returns values

Using if / else conditional logic

Basic program structure and clean output messages

🧪 Example Workflow

User enters:

First number → 10

Second number → 5

User selects operation → addition

Output shows:
Result: 15
